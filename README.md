# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The data for this analysis came from stock data for green energy companies. The purpose of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of the investment returns that various green energy stocks have seen in order to make investment decisions.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes for 2017

We can see from this analysis that 11 of the 12 stocks saw positive returns in 2017. The only stock that saw a negative return was TERP which had a -7.2% return. This shows that 2017 was a good year to invest in these types of companies.

### Analysis of Outcomes for 2018

We can see from this analysis that there were far fewer stocks with positive returns for this year. In fact there are only two, ENPH and RUN. These two stocks have returns in the 80% range which means that they did fairly good for the year. The fact that there is such an overwhelming negative return from these stocks could be caused by some external factor that made these companies less profitable and competitive.

### Analysis of Outcomes for Execution Times

For these two runs of the code, the execution times were very similar at .5078 for 2017 and .5394 for 2018. This was about .1 seconds quicker than the previous code.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I had some difficulty using the arrays as I made some mistakes with how I defined the arrays and therefore my for loops didn't work. I also had some trouble with incorrectly defining data types though I was able to figure that out decently quickly. 

## Results

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Advantages of refactoring code are that there is less typing that is necessary. If you have already coded something it is very ueful to be able to reuse and refactor code that you have done before. The disadvantages of refactoring code include the fact that it can actually end up taking more time to change the names of variables and making small changes to the code to make it work than it would take to write it from scratch. It is good to think over how much of the code can be reused before decidig to refactor it to make sure that you are using your time wisely. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

These pros and cons apply to this VBA script because there are many pieces of the original script that we could reuse but there are some that it would be easier to start over with.
